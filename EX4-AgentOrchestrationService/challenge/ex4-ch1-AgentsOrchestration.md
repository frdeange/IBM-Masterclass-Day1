## 📝 **Challenge Description**

Based on your Exercise 3 Challenge 4 solution and the `ex4-s1-FoundryAgentsOrch.py` sample, create a **Development Project Analyzer** that orchestrates your three specialized agents automatically:

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 15px 0; color: white;">

### 🎯 **Your Mission**

Transform your independent agents into a coordinated system where:

1. **🔍 A single user query** triggers automatic coordination between all three agents
2. **🤖 A Master Development Agent** orchestrates the workflow intelligently  
3. **🔗 ConnectedAgentTool** enables seamless agent-to-agent communication
4. **📊 Comprehensive analysis** combines results from all specialized agents
5. **🎯 Unified output** presents a complete development project analysis

**🌟 Goal**: One query → Automatic orchestration → Complete analysis!

## 📋 **Technical Requirements**

### 🥇 **Basic Level (20-25 minutes)** ✅ MAIN GOAL

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #28a745; margin: 10px 0;">

**Perfect for learning agent orchestration fundamentals!**

- [ ] ✅ **Reuse Your EX3-CH4 Agents**: Code Analyst, GitHub Explorer, Documentation Expert
- [ ] ✅ **Create ConnectedAgentTool**: Wrap each agent as a connected tool
- [ ] ✅ **Master Coordinator Agent**: Create an agent that orchestrates all three
- [ ] ✅ **Single Query Workflow**: One user input activates the entire analysis chain
- [ ] ✅ **Combined Output**: Display the final result of the 3 agents' work

</div>

### 🌟 **Advanced Level (Extra 10 minutes for fast finishers)** ⭐ BONUS

## 💡 **Getting Started Hints**

### � **Basic Level Implementation**

<details>
<summary>🔍 <strong>Click to see agent reuse strategy</strong></summary>

**Agents to Copy from EX3-CH4:**

- **Code Analyst Agent**: With FunctionTool and `analyze_code_metrics` function
- **GitHub Explorer Agent**: With OpenApiTool for GitHub API access
- **Documentation Expert Agent**: With McpTool for Microsoft Learn access

**Key Changes for Orchestration:**
- Same agent definitions, but now used as ConnectedAgentTool
- No need to modify the original agent logic
- Focus on the orchestration layer, not individual agent functionality

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>ConnectedAgentTool Pattern</strong></summary>

**Template Structure:**
```python
# Create connected agent tools (one for each specialist)
specialist_tool1 = ConnectedAgentTool(
    id=specialist_agent.id,
    name="tool_name", 
    description="What this agent specializes in"
)
### create the other two tools similarly ###

# Use in master agent
master_agent = agents_client.create_agent(
    model=deployment_name,
    name="Master Development Agent",
    instructions="Orchestration instructions here...",
    tools=[
        specialist_tool1.definitions[0],
        specialist_tool2.definitions[0], 
        specialist_tool3.definitions[0]º
    ]
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🚀 <strong>Test Queries to Try</strong></summary>

**Simple Development Queries:**
- "Analyze Python machine learning projects"
- "Find information about Azure Functions development"  
- "Evaluate REST API development tools"

**Advanced Queries:**
- "I want to learn containerization - find popular Docker projects and official documentation"
- "Help me understand microservices architecture with real examples and Microsoft guidance"

</details>

## 🔧 **Implementation Guide**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Foundation**
Copy your three specialized agents from EX3 Challenge 4 solution exactly as they are.

### **Step 2: Create Connected Tools**
Wrap each specialist agent with ConnectedAgentTool, following the pattern from the EX4-S1 sample.

### **Step 3: Build the Master Agent**
Create a coordinator agent that uses all three connected tools and knows how to orchestrate them.

### **Step 4: Implement Single-Query Workflow**
Use `create_and_process()` method to handle the entire orchestration automatically.

### **Step 5: Test the Orchestration**
Verify that a single user query activates all relevant specialists and produces combined results.

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### ✅ **You'll know you've succeeded when:**

**Basic Level:**
- Single user query automatically activates multiple specialist agents
- ConnectedAgentTool enables seamless agent-to-agent communication
- Master agent coordinates the workflow without manual intervention
- Output combines insights from Code Analyst, GitHub Explorer, and Documentation Expert
- The orchestration follows the EX4-S1 sample pattern successfully

## 🆘 **Common Issues & Solutions**

<details>
<summary>❗ <strong>ConnectedAgentTool Not Working</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Master agent doesn't call specialist agents

**Solutions**:
- Verify `.definitions[0]` is used correctly in master agent tools list
- Check that specialist agent IDs are valid
- Ensure ConnectedAgentTool descriptions are clear and specific
- Confirm master agent instructions mention when to use each tool

</details>

<details>
<summary>❗ <strong>Orchestration Breaks</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Workflow stops or fails during execution

**Solutions**:
- Use `create_and_process()` method for automatic handling
- Check individual specialist agents work independently first
- Verify Azure AI Foundry endpoint and credentials are correct
- Ensure all required tools (FunctionTool, OpenApiTool, McpTool) are properly configured

</details>

<details>
<summary>❗ <strong>Results Not Combining</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Getting individual agent outputs, not orchestrated results

**Solutions**:
- Improve master agent instructions to be more specific about coordination
- Ensure master agent understands its role as a coordinator
- Check that all ConnectedAgentTool descriptions are accurate
- Verify the workflow is using the master agent, not individual specialists

</details>
